            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>(Our game PROJECTION is curently in progress)</p>
            <p>
            Projection is a 2D Infinte Level game, Or is it? In 
            PROJECTION you navigate procedurally generated rooms 
            fighting enimies spawning from a spawner, you must 
            destroy the spawner in the room so you can stop the 
            monsters from spawning THERE. You have a battery that 
            is empty and through machines you can turn in documents 
            for a bit of battery, Every time you hurt and enimie you 
            gain Documents based on the attack and damage done, sometimes
             when you enter a room there could be a machine to fill up your
              battery you can not reuse the machines so you will need to 
              find a new one. After your battery is filled you must find 
              your way back but if you destroyed the spawners you will 
              be safe walking back, you must reach the elevator 
              you started in, turn in your battery, and get in 
              the elevator, Then you will be entering the next level,
